# RSA Exercises - Golang

## Exercise 6: Followup work

As part of learning Python you could choose to do some of these tasks yourself to follow up
getting experience:

1. Arbitrary message encryption: Modify the script to take an argument from the command
   line to encrypt and display any arbitrary message.
2. Save keys to a file: Modify the script to write the key pair you generate to a file
   and then load it back on startup.
3. Load ciphertext and keys from file: Modify the script to read a ciphertext that you
   created earlier as well as a key from disk and decrypt / output the message.
4. Key Size and Security: Modify the RSA script to experiment with different key sizes 
   (e.g., 512 bits, 1024 bits, 2048 bits). Generate key pairs with different sizes and 
   observe the impact on encryption and decryption time.
5. Signing: Write a secondary function of the code to take an arbitrary file and produce
   a digital signature that can be used to digitally verify the integrity of the message.
